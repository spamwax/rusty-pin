# rusty-pin
Subset of Pinboard's API in pure Rust

This is mainly written to enable an [Alfred Workflow](https://github.com/spamwax/alfred-pinboard-rs) to manage bookmarks from within the Alfred app.

## Note
Expect a lot of breaking changes as the API is getting stabilized.

## Changelog

Change logs are now kept in a [separate document](./CHANGELOG.md).
